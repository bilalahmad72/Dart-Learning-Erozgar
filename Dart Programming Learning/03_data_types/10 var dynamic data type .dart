// Hello, students! ðŸ“š
// Today's class was packed with learning! We delved into the following topics:
// Late Modifier: We explored why it's used and its pivotal role in certain situations.
// Dynamic Data Type: We compared it with the 'var' keyword to understand their differences.
// String Interpolation: We discussed string literals and how to use expressions within them.

// Now, it's your turn to implement these concepts on your end.

// Feel free to experiment and explore. If you come across any questions or challenges, let's discuss and help each other out. Learning is a journey, and together, we'll make it an enriching one!

void main() {

  // option-1

  abc = 323.23;
